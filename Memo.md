# IDEAS 

- [ ] how to create something that when i click on it a popup showsup with other bottons to click on them ?? 

## 
1. trying to install "Openssh" to try and ssh into my environment
2. trying to install some of other window managers such as "QTILE" "dwm" rather then the one is use "i3 wm".

> cause dwm is written `C` and configurable in it as well . and qtile is written in `python` .
> and Xmonad . written in haskel .
> some say that the best are : awesome , qtile , xmonad.

3. making a new rofi theme so i can click the arch logo in polybar and run a theme that doesnot look like the one from MOD+P .
i will be using the rofi theme collection as starting point to learn how to do it.


4. i installed `tigervnc-server` remember to remove it .
**Idea** : 
the arch botton in polybar can run anycommand , so if i can  program a command that i really need or at least get a list of commands that i want.



## stuff to name later
### Nomachine 
i think i found a program to acces the desktop environment wirelessly "nomachine" / it needs a desktop environment or window manager runnging so it can run . 
> i dont know if it will run properly but at least there is something .
