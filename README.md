## i3-wm window manager
just copy the config file to its place 

using with it a script that makes i3 dynamic

## notes for my self
the `u.sh` file is to update the repo without typing the commands each time . just run the command when you finish. iknow it not good but it works . 
> you can add it as an alias in bashrc file as followes : 
`alias gu='cd git/arch && ./u.sh && cd'
